            <li>We provide avenues for students who do not understand any course being taught in the classroom to request for a tutor on that course at no expense because we have everyone covered.</li>
<li>We also provide avenues for the exceptional students who are good at a particular course and would like to help others out in understanding it, while at the same time making money with it, because we also have them covered, as we pay them for any tutorial, we refer them for.</li>
<li>With our 24/7 well-conditioned reading facility, students no longer have to bother about where to read, as our facility is well equipped for maximum learning and understanding.</li>
<li>Through our website, we will provide course materials for all courses including past questions and key notes, such that no student ever must worry about inadequate or irrelevant materials, because we got all that covered.</li>
